# Kingdom-of-mechanical-test-for-deciv.
Mod for deciv where I can test my own ideas.

THe Main faction of this mod is "The Forgotten Kingdom of Wasteland". (This is the main branch that only adds this faction
Second Branch is a small expansion of this mod with 3 extra factions, 3 extra wonders and 1 Extra city state. (In future I could add possible buildings for all factions)
Cuz I'm new to Unciv modding scene please take the balancing and my lore-writing with some grain of salt. (I accept any criticism BUT it needs to have arms and legs)

This mod Should be compatibatile with other mods and especially with the "Outlaws of The Wastes" mod by The-S-is-silent.

This mod addons:
3 New Ancient Wonders
- Crystal Waterfall - The only place of clear water deposits unaffected by radiation or contamination of the wasteland
- Bunker Alfa - The Last place of the old world goverments and anyone willing to pay the stay. Now vacant, holds a lot of goodies.
- Sea Platform - Forgotten even before the Cataclysm yet still stands proud above the sea. If you listen close there is a chance that you'll hear its lullaby

Its Wonders
- White Snow Resort - Sometimes scarcity can turn into a luxury. Gives culture to all mountian tiles.
- Crystal Glacier Sanctuary

3 New World Wonders
Oceanic De-extinction Project -  a rather small project that aims to repopulate the seas with either with pre-cataclysm or post-cataclysm marine life
Humanity's Revival Memorial -  Build to those who sacrificed themself to create this blooming future
Laser Cutting Facility - Specialized factory which blueprints have been lost to time. Now when the humanity has revived this beauty existence is just a matter to time ( this could be an EVENT wonder - "The Blueprints")
